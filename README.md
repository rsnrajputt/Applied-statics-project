# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics

## Problem Statement

Welcome to the Probability and Statistics project! In this project, we aim to analyze customer information and purchasing behavior to make informed decisions. Our goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations to optimize marketing efforts and increase offer acceptance rates.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains customer information and purchasing behavior, including demographics, complaints, and spending habits. Here's a brief overview of the dataset:

- Response (target) - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise
- ID - Unique ID of each customer
- Year_Birth - Age of the customer
- Complain - 1 if the customer complained in the last 2 years
- Dt_Customer - date of customer's enrollment with the company
- Education - customer's level of education
- Marital - customer's marital status
- Kidhome - number of small children in customer's household
- Teenhome - number of teenagers in customer's household
- Income - customer's yearly household income
- ...

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Basic CleanUp

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze the distribution of customer demographics using descriptive statistics and visualizations

### Task 2: Descriptive Statistics

- Calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion for key variables
- Identify and handle outliers if necessary

### Task 3: Probability Distributions

- Identify variables that could follow specific probability distributions
- Calculate probabilities and expected values based on these distributions

### Task 4: Insights and Customer Segmentation

- Explore relationships between customer characteristics and spending habits
- Segment customers based on their behaviors and characteristics

### Task 5: Conclusion and Recommendations

- Create clear visualizations to showcase findings
- Make recommendations for the company based on the analysis

## Bonus Task - GeoGebra Experiment

- Experiment with coin flips to understand the Law of Large Numbers
- Record a video explaining the concept using the experiment
